Design a program for the Hollywood Movie Rating Guide, in which users continuously enter a value from 0 to 5 that indicates the number of stars they are awarding to a movie title they are prompted for. The program executes continuously until a user decides to quit. If a user enters a star value that does not fall in the correct range, re-prompt the user three (3) times until a correct value is entered. At the end of the program, display the average star rating for the movie.
